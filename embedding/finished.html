    <p>What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her. Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!</p>

    <p>Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!</p>

    <p>Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.</p>

    <p>So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.</p>

    <p>You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy. I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.</p>

    <p>Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.</p>

    <p>Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie.</p>

    <p>Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?</p>

    <p>Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!</p>

    <p>Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!</p>

    <p>No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!</p>
